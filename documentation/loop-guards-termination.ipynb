    "But, Polar guarantees that for the loops it accepts it will theoretically be able to give an answer. That is why not any loop guard is allowed.\n",
    "The restrictions on the loop guard are the same as the ones for the if-conditions: *all variables in the loop guard must only assume finitely many values*.\n",

Moreover, the loop has an expected runtime of `2` and surprisingly the expected value of `x` after termination is infinite. This phenomenon can be intuitively explained as follows: later iterations become more and more unlikely. The chance of not terminating decreases exponentially. However, the value of `x` increases exponentially. The exponential decrease of the probability of non-termination and the exponential increase of `x` cancel each other out.\n",
