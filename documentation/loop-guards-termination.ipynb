    "But, Polar guarantees that for the loops it accepts it will theoretically be able to give an answer. That is why not any loop guard is allowed.\n",

Moreover, the loop has an expected runtime of `2` and surprisingly the expected value of `x` after termination is infinite. This phenomenon can be intuitively explained as follows: later iterations become more and more unlikely. The chance of not terminating decreases exponentially.
