    Constants are variables not reassigned in the loop body. The transformer processes constants in two ways:
    1. If the constant is a single fixed value it removes its initial assignment and replaces it everywhere
    by its value.

    2. If the constant x is more than a single fixed value it adds the assignment x=x at the end of the loop body.

    The transformer requires that the program is flattened.
