    Normalizes the conditions in the program. That means that inequalities are replaced by conjunctions of

        Basic idea: If an atom "failed" we have to consider the whole conjunct it appears in as "failed",

        with one bad condition C = Bad1 and Bad2 and Bad3 ... and Badk
        Now the following has to hold

        1. C is iteration independent
        2. C is independent of variables in assignment which were already assigned in this iteration
        3. C is independent of variables in good condition part which have already been assigned.

        Then we can replace C by Bernoulli(p) == 1 where p = P(C at current pos)
        If C already has been abstracted as Bernoulli(p) and none of the variables in C have been reassigned since
        then we use the old abstraction. If the have been reassigned we need to introduce a new abstraction.
