I found a solution. Maybe I won't tell you.
Synthesized solvable loop:
types
    z : Finite(0, 1)
end
_t6 = 0
_s5 = (1/3)*x0*_u3 + (1/3)*y0*_u3
z = _t6
while true:
    _t6 = 1 - z
    _s5 = 2*_s5 + _u3 - z*_u3
    z = _t6
end

Invariant used:
((1/3)*x*_u3 + (1/3)*y*_u3, (1/6)*_u3*(2*2**n*(x0 + y0) + 3*2**_k7*n*(1 - (-1)**(-_k7 + n))))
